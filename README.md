### Instructions for following the workshop. 
Start with the "master" branch of the repository, and look at the script.sh file. <br> 
The file contains the instructions for a task. Code the solution below the instructions. <br> 
<br> 
Once you're done coding the solution, switch to branch T1_Done to view the answer key for that task and compare your solutions. The answer key is followed by the instructions for the next task.

Repeat the exercise until you have coded the solutions to all the tasks
